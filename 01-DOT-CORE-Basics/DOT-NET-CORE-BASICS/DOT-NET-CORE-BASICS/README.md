Security Warning
---------------------------
You are about to install a certificate from a certification authority (CA) claiming to represent:



localhost



Windows cannot validate that the certificate is actually from "localhost". You should confirm its origin by contacting "localhost". The following number will assist you in this process:



Thumbprint (sha1): 98DAA523 469D9892 258CE989 70BE8886 960BDE90



Warning:

If you install this root certificate, Windows will automatically trust any certificate issued by this CA. Installing a certificate with an unconfirmed thumbprint is a security risk. If you click "Yes" you acknowledge this risk.



Do you want to install this certificate?
